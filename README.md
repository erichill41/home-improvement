## Application Use Case
- Homeowners who are looking to organize their projects, bills, budget, and any other homeowner helpful tools.

## Why This Was Made
- My girlfriend and I recently purchased a house, with so many projects we would like to accomplish around the house, we needed a way to organize/prioritize them.
